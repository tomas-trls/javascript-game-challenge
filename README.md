# 🌟 JavaScript Fighting Game 🥊

This project is a fighting game, it was my biggest challenge since joining \_Nology and it helped me showcase my skills in front-end development, particularly in CSS and JavaScript.
It helped me understand Functional Javascript but I also started to learn and understand the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with `classes` and the `extends` keyword.

One of my goals as a developer was to learn HTML5 Canvas and I am thrilled that I was able to achieve this through this project. I had the opportunity to work with HTML5 Canvas from scratch and I learned a lot about how to manipulate the canvas, create animations, and more.

My next big step would be to continue expanding my knowledge in new technologies and I would be thrilled to learn Three.JS to implement 3D in my projects. I believe that this project showcases not only my technical skills but also my quick learning abilities, as I had to start from scratch with HTML5 Canvas.

I would like to give credit to <a href="https://chriscourses.com/">Chris Course</a> that has done excellent Tutorials on HTML5 Canvas. Specially because his courses helped me understand some core concepts of OOP using canvas. But also <a href="https://luizmelo.itch.io/">Luiz Melo</a> that sells free pixel art characters assets on Itch.io and <a href="https://ansimuz.itch.io/">Ansimuz</a> that provided the background for free too on Itch.io.

## 🚀 Future Features & Issues 🚀

- I need to fix the death animation loop.
- I need to block the characters from going out of screen.
- I'd like to add a block action to allow the players to block incoming damage!
- I'd like to make the characters able to turn on the vertical axis, so if they jump over one and other, they can turn around.
- I need to fix the hitbox of the attacks.
